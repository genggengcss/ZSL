use liblinear to train the logistic regression so as to get the predicted class membership in ConSE.  

##### Training and Testing
Run "training.m", training the logistic regression first
You will need to train the logistic regression  first. you run "training.m" to get results.  
then you will need to runing "testing.m" to get the answer of the model testing.  

 
C and T are the parameters of conse  

T: top T predicted results
